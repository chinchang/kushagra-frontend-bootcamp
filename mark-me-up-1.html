        <p>This is basic <abbr>HTML</abbr> (HyperText Markup Language) file. But right now, all it has is some text dumped into it. Your mission is to mark up this text so that it is more structured, readable and semantic.</p>
        <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is the language of the web. It is used to create web pages. To quote the great Sir John Doe:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://johndoequotes.com">
            <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is like water (H<sub>2</sub>O) - You can't see it, but that is the <em>"life"</em> of a web page.</p>
